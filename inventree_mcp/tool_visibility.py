"""Filter tools/list results down to what the current caller can actually use.

Every tool is always *registered* (so its schema/description stays a single
source of truth - see output_schemas.py) - but a caller without the
underlying API endpoint's permission would only ever get a ToolError from
actually calling it. This makes a real tools/list request reflect that up
front: a tool is only listed if the current user (and, for OAuth2 requests,
their token's scope) can really reach the resource it wraps - determined by
running the *real* permission check via proxy.user_has_access() (RolePermission
/ OAuth2 scope, the same InvenTree.permissions machinery call_view() itself
relies on), not a hand-rolled guess.

This is a discovery-time convenience, not a new security boundary:
proxy.call_view() remains the only real enforcement point, and still runs in
full for every actual tool call regardless of what tools/list showed - a
client that calls a "hidden" tool by name gets exactly the same ToolError it
always did (see MCPServer.call_tool()'s own tool lookup, which never
consults this module). Don't rely on this module to prevent access to
anything; it only prevents *advertising* access that doesn't exist.

Why a real permission check via "GET" rather than a literal HTTP OPTIONS
request (the obvious-looking shortcut): InvenTree's OAuth2 scope resolver
(map_scope() in InvenTree/permissions.py) hardcodes OPTIONS to a generic
"g:read" scope for every view regardless of resource, while GET requires the
real resource-specific scope (e.g. "r:view:part"). An OPTIONS-based check
would show a tool as available to an OAuth2 token scoped down to "g:read"
only, even though the real GET call that tool actually makes would then be
rejected - silently defeating the exact "narrow a token below the user's
role" scenario this plugin exists to support correctly. Checking "GET"
instead sidesteps that gap entirely (and is also correct for the
role/RolePermission path, which maps OPTIONS and GET to the same "view"
permission anyway - see proxy.user_has_access()'s docstring for the full
comparison).

    A tool with no entry in _TOOL_RESOURCES (e.g. describe_filters) is

    If there's no request at all (e.g. static introspection outside a real
    MCP request - see OutputSchemaTest in test_mcp.py, which calls
    mcp.list_tools() directly without binding an identity), every name is
    returned unfiltered, since there's no caller to filter *by* - this is
    not a real request path, so there's nothing unsafe about it.

    A real request that resolved to an unauthenticated identity (e.g.
    REQUIRE_AUTH disabled and no credentials were sent) is deliberately
    *not* treated the same as "no request" above - has_bound_identity()
    (not has_current_user()) gates the unfiltered fallback, so this case
    falls through into the per-tool loop below instead. Every gated tool
