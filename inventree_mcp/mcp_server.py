"""The MCPServer instance and tool registry for InvenTree MCP.

InvenTree's plugin registry walks every submodule of a plugin package at
discovery time (plugin.helpers.get_modules) and may pass arbitrary
module-level objects through inspect.getmembers() while looking for
InvenTreePlugin subclasses. Doing that to a live MCPServer instance can touch
lazily-computed properties (e.g. session_manager, which raises RuntimeError
if accessed before streamable_http_app() has ever been called) before the
server has ever been run. Setting __all__ = [] here keeps this instance out
of that scan without changing how it's imported elsewhere (`from .mcp_server
import mcp` still works - __all__ only affects `from module import *` and
the registry's own name-filtering).

stateless_http/json_response are no longer MCPServer constructor arguments
(mcp 2.0's breaking rewrite moved them onto streamable_http_app() /
run_streamable_http_async()) - they're passed directly to the
StreamableHTTPSessionManager mcp_transport.py constructs instead.
