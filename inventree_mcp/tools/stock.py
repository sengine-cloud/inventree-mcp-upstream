    Returns a paginated envelope: {count, next, previous, results}. Each
    entry in `results` has the same shape as get_stock_item's return value -
    use its `pk` field with get_stock_item to fetch full detail for one of
    them.

    Args:
        part: restrict to stock of this Part ID (includes variants of the part).
        location: restrict to stock held at this StockLocation ID.
        in_stock: True for only items that are actually usable right now -
            quantity > 0, not allocated to a sales order/customer/build, not
            currently mid-build, and in an "available" status (excludes e.g.
            rejected/destroyed/lost stock). False for the inverse. Omit to
            include both.
        ordering: field to sort results by, e.g. "-quantity" for highest
            quantity first ('-' prefix for descending, omit it for
            ascending). Combine with limit to get a "top N by X" result, e.g.
            ordering="-quantity", limit=5 for the 5 largest stock items. Call
            describe_filters("stock") and check its ordering_fields list for
            valid values - an unrecognized field is silently ignored (no
            error, no sort) rather than rejected.
        filters: additional filter parameters beyond the named arguments
            above - call describe_filters("stock") to see what's available,
            e.g. filters={"low_stock": true}.
        limit: maximum number of results to return - defaults to 100 (the
            maximum) to minimize round trips for large result sets; pass a
            smaller value to page through results in smaller batches.
        offset: pagination offset.
